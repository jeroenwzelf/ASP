_Audio Streaming Protocol - an UDP-based network protocol_

This repository contains an implementation (written in C) of a custom protocol that enables a server to stream audio to other clients over UDP/IP.
The specification of this custom protocol is also available on here.

This project has been set up for a Computer Science assignment for the subject on Networking, Leiden University. See [the original assignment](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~wijshoffhag/NETWERKEN2019/assignment2.pdf "LIACS Networking assignment 2 - 2019").
